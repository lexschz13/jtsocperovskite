# Jahn-Teller effect with spin-orbit coupling and electromagnetic intersite hoppings

This package computes the interaction of an electromagnetic field with the system described in https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.165108.
It consists of a transition metal with electrons in d-orbitals surrounded by six oxygen ligands, forming an octahedral coordinated systems that corresponds to the unit cell of a perovskite. The Solver class creates a system with 2x2x2 metal sites with periodical boundary conditions.
Every metal site is described with 19 orbitals. The model asssumes that the interaction with the magnetic field induces electron transfer in a lattice. During the photoinduced transfer, the system takes into account cooperative Jahn-Teller effects. To calculate the photoinduced hopping amplitudes, the relative orientation of spins with respect to Jahn-Teller elongations is taken into account, as well as the propagation direction of light and its polarization. The package has the possibility to make a random distribution of the spins of every metal site following a Kent distribution.
