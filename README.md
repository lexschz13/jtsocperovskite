# Jahn-Teller effect with spin-orbit coupling and electromagnetic intersite hoppings

This package computes the system described in https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.165108.

The Solver class creates a system with 2x2x2 metal sites with periodical boundary conditions.
Every metal site is described with 19 orbitals.
The system takes into account the cooperative Jahn-Teller effects.
The package have the possibility to make a random distribution of the spins of every metal site following the Kent distribution.
